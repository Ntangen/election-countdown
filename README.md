<h2>Is the Election Over Yet?</h2>

<h3>Election countdown app</h3>

This is where I'm working on my [twitter app](http://www.twitter.com/isitoveryet2016) that will return the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until the 2016 U.S. election is over. You can see the web version [here.](http://www.istheelectionoveryet.com)

<b>Mark1</b> - returns a countdown to a specific user. Still working on traversing the timeline and incorporating streams.
